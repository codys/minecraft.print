---WHAT IS THIS?---
Minecraft.Print() is a python library for converting defined regions of Minecraft levels to a 3D Printable format.


---REQUIREMENTS/SETUP---
python    - (http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.6/)
numpy     - (http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/OldFiles/ or http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)
pymclevel - (already included)


---INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE---
Step One:
    Build something awesome in Minecraft.

Step Two:
    Define the space you wish to print by placing two markers, in-game. The marker configuration is a diamond block, followed by a gold block, followed by an iron block in vertical order (ascending or descending). The coordinates of the diamond block will be used as the marker.

Step Three Point One:
    Ensure that the save file is in your normal single player directory (this step really only matters if you are trying to process an SMP level).
    Windows - C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves
    Mac     - [username]/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves
    Linux   - /home/[username]/.minecraft/saves

Step Three Point Magic:
    Run the following command from the terminal, replacing [level_name] and [output_name] with the level you wish to process and the desired output file name. The script will then run and save the STL file in the same directory. Note: the script does not need to be in the same folder as your save files (it knows where to find them).
    Windows         - "run.py [level_name] [output_name]"
    Mac or Linux    - "python run.py [level_name] [output_name]"


---VIEWING AN STL FILE---
MeshLab - http://meshlab.sourceforge.net


---PRINTING---
Option One:
    Print the STL file using a 3D Printer that you have access to.

Option Two:
    Use an online service that will allow you to upload an STL file and order a print. 
    Examples - cloudfab.com and shapeways.com


---SHOWING OFF YOUR CREATIONS---
We figure you already know how to do this.


---SHARING YOUR CREATIONS---
So here's the deal. We want to see what awesome stuff you guys are going to print. So drop us a line at hi@minecraftprint.com and let us know how it went. Also, if you have something really awesome, consider putting the model up on thingiverse.com for others to see and print.
